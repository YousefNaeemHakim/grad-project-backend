# Grokking Algorithms

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Algorithms

This chapter provides an introduction to algorithms and explains their importance in computer science. It discusses how algorithms are used to solve problems and introduces common algorithm analysis techniques such as Big O notation.

```python
# Example code for a simple linear search algorithm
def linear_search(lst, target):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if lst[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1
```
## Chapter 2: Selection Sort

This chapter introduces the selection sort algorithm, which is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest element from an unsorted list and moving it to the front. The chapter provides a step-by-step example of how the algorithm works and discusses its time complexity.

```python
# Example code for the selection sort algorithm
def selection_sort(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        min_index = i
        for j in range(i+1, len(lst)):
            if lst[j] < lst[min_index]:
                min_index = j
        lst[i], lst[min_index] = lst[min_index], lst[i]
    return lst
```

## Chapter 3: Recursion

This chapter introduces the concept of recursion and explains how it can be used to solve problems. It discusses the basic structure of a recursive function and provides examples of recursive functions that calculate factorials and Fibonacci numbers.

```python
# Example code for a recursive factorial function
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```

## Chapter 4: Quicksort

This chapter introduces the quicksort algorithm, which is a more efficient sorting algorithm than selection sort. The chapter provides a step-by-step example of how the algorithm works and discusses its time complexity.

```python
# Example code for the quicksort algorithm
def quicksort(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return lst
    else:
        pivot = lst[0]
        left = [x for x in lst[1:] if x < pivot]
        right = [x for x in lst[1:] if x >= pivot]
        return quicksort(left) + [pivot] + quicksort(right)
```

## Chapter 5: Hash Tables

This chapter introduces the concept of hash tables and explains how they can be used to implement dictionaries and other data structures. The chapter discusses the basic structure of a hash table and provides examples of how to implement hash tables in Python.

```python
# Example code for a simple hash table implementation in Python
class HashTable:
    def __init__(self):
        self.size = 10
        self.table = [[] for _ in range(self.size)]

    def _hash_function(self, key):
        return hash(key) % self.size

    def add(self, key, value):
        index = self._hash_function(key)
        self.table[index].append((key, value))

    def get(self, key):
        index = self._hash_function(key)
        for k, v in self.table[index]:
            if k == key:
                return v
        raise KeyError(key)
```

## Chapter 6: Breadth-First Search

This chapter introduces the breadth-first search algorithm, which is used to traverse and search through graphs. The chapter provides a step-by-step example of how the algorithm works and discusses its time complexity.

```python
# Example code for the breadth-first search algorithm
def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = [start]
    while queue:
        node = queue.pop(0)
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            queue.extend(graph[node] - visited)
    return visited
```

## Chapter 7: Dijkstra's Algorithm

This chapter introduces Dijkstra's algorithm, which is used to find the shortest path in a weighted graph. The chapter provides a step-by-step example of how the algorithm works and discusses its time complexity.

```python
# Example code for Dijkstra's algorithm
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    pq = [(0, start)]
    while pq:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(pq)
        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))
    return distances
```

## Chapter 8: Greedy Algorithms

This chapter introduces the concept of greedy algorithms, which make locally optimal choices at each step in order to find a globally optimal solution. The chapter provides examples of greedy algorithms for the knapsack problem and the set-cover problem.

```python
# Example code for the knapsack problem using a greedy algorithm
def knapsack_greedy(items, max_weight):
    items = sorted(items, key=lambda x: x[1]/x[0], reverse=True)
    total_value = 0
    total_weight = 0
    for i, (weight, value) in enumerate(items):
        if total_weight + weight > max_weight:
            break
        total_weight += weight
        total_value += value
    return total_value
```

## Chapter 9: Dynamic Programming

This chapter introduces the concept of dynamic programming, which breaks down a problem into smaller subproblems and uses the solutions to those subproblems to solve the larger problem. The chapter provides examples of dynamic programming algorithms for the Fibonacci sequence and the knapsack problem.

```python
# Example code for a simple linear search algorithm
# Example code for the Fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    memo = [0] * (n+1)
    memo[0] = 0
    memo[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        memo[i] = memo[i-1] + memo[i-2]
    return memo[n]
```

## Chapter 10: K-Nearest Neighbors

This chapter introduces the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, which is used for classification and regression problems. The chapter provides a step-by-step example of how the algorithm works and discusses its time complexity.

```python
# Example code for the Fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming
# Example code for a simple k-nearest neighbors algorithm
import math

def distance(point1, point2):
    return math.sqrt(sum([(a-b)**2 for a, b in zip(point1, point2)]))

def k_nearest_neighbors(data, query, k):
    distances = [(distance(query, d[0]), d[1]) for d in data]
    sorted_distances = sorted(distances, key=lambda x: x[0])
    return [d[1] for d in sorted_distances[:k]]
```
