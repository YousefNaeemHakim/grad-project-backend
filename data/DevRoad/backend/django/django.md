# Django Learning Summary

Django is a high-level Python web framework that allows developers to quickly and easily build web applications. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and provides a lot of built-in functionality, such as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer, a templating engine, and built-in security features.

## Installation

To install Django, you can use pip, which is the package installer for Python. Here's an example:

```
pip install django

```

## Creating a Django Project

To create a new Django project, you can use the `django-admin` command-line tool. Here's an example:

```
django-admin startproject myproject
```

This will create a new directory called `myproject` that contains the basic structure of a Django project.

## Creating a Django App

In Django, an app is a self-contained module that performs a specific task within a project. To create a new app, you can use the `manage.py` command-line tool. Here's an example:

```
python manage.py startapp myapp

```

This will create a new directory called `myapp` that contains the basic structure of a Django app.

## Models

In Django, a model is a Python class that represents a database table. Django provides an ORM layer that allows you to define your models in Python code and have them automatically translated into database tables. Here's an example:

```
from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    age = models.IntegerField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

```

This defines a `Person` model that has a `name` field and an `age` field.

## Views

In Django, a view is a Python function that handles an HTTP request and returns an HTTP response. Views can be used to display data, process form submissions, or perform any other task that involves interacting with the user. Here's an example:

```
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

def hello(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world!")

```

This defines a `hello` view that simply returns the string "Hello, world!" as an HTTP response.

## Templates

In Django, a template is a file that defines the structure and layout of a web page. Templates can be written in HTML, and they can include placeholders that are filled in with dynamic content at runtime. Here's an example:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>{{ title }}</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
    <p>{{ content }}</p>
</body>
</html>

```

This is a simple template that includes placeholders for a `title` and `content` variable.

## URLs

In Django, URLs are mapped to views using regular expressions. This allows you to create dynamic, flexible URLs that can be used to navigate to different parts of your application. Here's an example:

```
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('hello/', views.hello, name='hello'),
]

```

This maps the URL `/hello/` to the `hello` view.

## Admin Interface

Django provides a built-in admin interface that allows you to manage your application's data through a web-based interface. This can be a huge time-saver when developing your application, as it allows you to quickly create, update, and delete records without writing any code.

Here's an example of how to create an admin interface for the `Person` model we defined earlier:

```
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Person

admin.site.register(Person)

```

With this code, you can now navigate to `/admin` in your web browser to access the admin interface for your application.

## Middleware

Django provides a middleware layer that allows you to modify requests and responses at various points during the request/response cycle. This can be useful for tasks such as authentication, caching, and compression.

Here's an example of how to create a middleware that logs the duration of each request:

```
import time

class TimingMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response

    def __call__(self, request):
        start_time = time.time()
        response = self.get_response(request)
        duration = time.time() - start_time
        print(f"Request took {duration} seconds.")
        return response

```

With this code, you can add the `TimingMiddleware` class to your middleware settings in your `settings.py` file:

```
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # ...
    'myapp.middleware.TimingMiddleware',
    # ...
]

```

## Static Files

Django provides a built-in way to manage static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images. By default, Django serves static files from the `STATICFILES_DIRS` setting, which is a list of directories that contain your static files.

Here's an example of how to serve a CSS file in your template:

```
{% load static %}

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'css/styles.css' %}">

```

This code uses the `static` template tag to generate a URL for the `styles.css` file located in the `css` directory of your static files directory.
