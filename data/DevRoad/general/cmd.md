# Basics of Command Line

Command Line is a powerful tool for interacting with computers and performing various tasks. In this learning summary, we will cover some of the fundamental commands and concepts that will take you from zero to hero in using the command line.

## Basic Navigation and File Management

To navigate around the file system and manage files, use the following commands:

- `cd [directory]`: change to the specified directory.
- `ls`: list the contents of the current directory.
- `mkdir [directory]`: create a new directory.
- `touch [file]`: create a new file.
- `cp [source] [destination]`: copy a file or directory.
- `mv [source] [destination]`: move or rename a file or directory.
- `rm [file]`: delete a file.
- `rmdir [directory]`: delete a directory (if it's empty).

Here's an example of navigating to a directory and listing its contents:

```bash
cd Documents/ ls
```

## Working with Text Files

The command line can be used to create and edit text files using the following commands:

- `nano [file]`: open a file for editing with the Nano text editor.
- `cat [file]`: display the contents of a file.
- `grep [pattern] [file]`: search for a pattern in a file.
- `head [file]`: display the first few lines of a file.
- `tail [file]`: display the last few lines of a file.
- `sort [file]`: sort the lines of a file.

Here's an example of creating and editing a new text file:

```bash
nano myfile.txt
```

## Managing Processes and System Information

The command line can also be used to manage processes and get information about the system using the following commands:

- `ps`: list the currently running processes.
- `kill [process ID]`: send a signal to stop a process.
- `top`: display real-time information about system processes and resource usage.
- `df`: display information about disk usage.
- `free`: display information about system memory usage.

Here's an example of listing running processes:

```bash
ps
```

## Conclusion

This learning summary covers only the basics of using the command line, but it should provide a good starting point for further exploration. By mastering these commands and concepts, you'll be able to navigate around the file system, manage files and directories, create and edit text files, and get information about system processes and resources. With practice and experience, you can become a command line hero and use it to perform more complex tasks and automate workflows.
