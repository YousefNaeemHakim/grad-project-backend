# TypeScript
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to the language. In this learning summary, we will cover some of the fundamental concepts and syntax that will take you from zero to hero in TypeScript.

## Basic Syntax

TypeScript uses the same syntax as JavaScript, with the addition of optional type annotations. Here's an example of a basic TypeScript function with type annotations:

```ts
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

In this example, the `add` function takes two parameters (`a` and `b`) that are both of type `number`, and returns a value of type `number`.

## Type Annotations

Type annotations can be added to variables, parameters, and functions to specify their types. Here are some examples:

```ts
let message: string = "Hello, World!";
let age: number = 42;
let isStudent: boolean = true;

function greet(name: string): void {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

In this example, `message` is of type `string`, `age` is of type `number`, `isStudent` is of type `boolean`, and the `greet` function takes a parameter `name` of type `string` and returns nothing (`void`).

## Interfaces

Interfaces are used to define the structure of an object in TypeScript. Here's an example:

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

let person: Person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30
};
```

In this example, we define an interface `Person` with two properties (`name` and `age`), and then create an object `person` that conforms to that interface.

## Classes

Classes are used to define objects that have properties and methods. Here's an example of a basic TypeScript class:

```ts
class Rectangle {
  width: number;
  height: number;

  constructor(width: number, height: number) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }

  get area(): number {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}

let rect = new Rectangle(10, 20);
console.log(rect.area);
```

In this example, we define a `Rectangle` class with two properties (`width` and `height`) and a `get` accessor for the `area` property. We then create an instance of the class (`rect`) and call its `area` property.

## Generics

Generics are used to create reusable code that can work with a variety of data types. Here's an example:

```ts
function reverse<T>(items: T[]): T[] {
  return items.reverse();
}

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let reversed = reverse(numbers);
console.log(reversed);

let strings = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
let reversedStrings = reverse(strings);
console.log(reversedStrings);
```

In this example, we define a `reverse` function that takes an array of type `T` and returns an array of type `T`. We then call the function with two different types of arrays (`numbers` and `strings`).

## Conclusion

This learning summary covers only the basics of TypeScript, but it should provide a good starting point for further exploration. By mastering these concepts and syntax, you'll be able to create robust and maintainable code that takes full advantage of TypeScript's powerful features. With practice and experience, you can become a TypeScript hero and use it to build complex and scalable applications.
