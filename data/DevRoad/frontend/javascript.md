# JavaScript: Making Web Pages Dynamic

JavaScript is a programming language used to create interactive and dynamic websites. It is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to add functionality to web pages.

## Variables

Variables are used to store and manipulate data in JavaScript. They can hold different types of values, such as numbers, strings, and booleans. Here's an example of how to declare and assign a variable in JavaScript:

```js
let myVariable = 'Hello World!';
const PI = 3.14;
```

## Functions

Functions are blocks of code that can be called multiple times with different arguments. They can be used to perform specific tasks or calculations. Here's an example of how to define and call a function in JavaScript:

```js
function addNumbers(a, b) {
    return a + b; 
} 

let result = addNumbers(2, 3); 
console.log(result); // Output: 5
```

## Conditionals

Conditionals are used to execute different blocks of code based on a specified condition. They can be used to create logic in a program. Here's an example of how to use an if statement in JavaScript:

```js
let myNumber = 5; if (myNumber > 0) { console.log('The number is positive'); } else if (myNumber < 0) { console.log('The number is negative'); } else { console.log('The number is zero'); }
```

## Loops

Loops are used to repeat blocks of code multiple times. They can be used to iterate over arrays or perform certain tasks a specified number of times. Here's an example of how to use a for loop in JavaScript:

```js
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) { console.log(myArray[i]); }
```


## Arrays

Arrays are used to store collections of data in JavaScript. They can hold different types of values, such as numbers, strings, and even other arrays. Here's an example of how to declare and manipulate an array in JavaScript:

```js
let myArray = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
console.log(myArray.length); // Output: 3

myArray.push('grape');
console.log(myArray); // Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape']

let firstElement = myArray[0];
console.log(firstElement); // Output: 'apple'
```

## Objects

Objects are used to store key-value pairs in JavaScript. They can hold different types of values, such as strings, numbers, and even functions. Here's an example of how to declare and manipulate an object in JavaScript:

```js
let myObject = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  greet: function() {
    console.log('Hello!');
  }
};

console.log(myObject.name); // Output: 'John'

myObject.job = 'developer';
console.log(myObject); // Output: { name: 'John', age: 30, greet: [Function: greet], job: 'developer' }
```

## DOM Manipulation

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a web page and allows JavaScript to manipulate it. Here's an example of how to change the text of an HTML element using JavaScript:

```html
<!-- HTML code -->
<p id="my-paragraph">This is a paragraph.</p>
```

```js
// JavaScript code 
let myParagraph = document.getElementById('my-paragraph'); myParagraph.textContent = 'This is a new paragraph.';
```

## Event Handling

Event handling is used to detect when a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking a button or scrolling. JavaScript can be used to respond to these events and perform specific actions. Here's an example of how to add an event listener to a button in JavaScript:

```html
<!-- HTML code -->
<button id="my-button">Click me!</button>
```

```js
// JavaScript code 
let myButton = document.getElementById('my-button'); myButton.addEventListener('click', function() { console.log('Button clicked!'); });
```

JavaScript is a powerful language that can be used to create complex and dynamic web pages. By mastering these basic concepts, you can start building your own interactive web applications.
